* ~~Capitalize constructors, Paper, Pen, Path, Point~~

* Move out best candidate into utl
* Find a place for point:newOAD(origin, angle, distance)
* Find place for shape functions
* ~~Create drawing directory~~

* Look at global paper (not needing to create and add pens)

* Add groups
* add compound paths

* Create shape functions
  * ~~line~~
  * cross
  * ~~rectangles~~
  * ~~regular polygon~~
  * regular polygon (squashed/ellipse)
  * 'arc' (regular polygon type arc)


* ~~Look into chaining methods~~
* Look into removing new e.g Point:new(x, y) > Point(x, y)
* Improve log function (standard table log)
* ~~Improve random~~
* Improve generators

* ~~Remove points from path~~
* ~~Insert points at a location to paths~~
* create random point

* ~~Set bounding box of paths~~
* ~~How to trigger bounding box reset~~

* ~~Rotate paths~~
* ~~Rotate path around it's self~~
* ~~Scale paths~~
* Flip paths

* offset paths
* outline paths

* pathfinder combine
* pathfinder remove
* pathfinder divide
* pathfinder intersect

* Join paths
* split paths

* look at probiblity random

* generalise best candidate

* ~~Get length of path~~
* ~~Get point from distance along a path~~
* ~~Get path intersections~~
* Improve get intersections
